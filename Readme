rpmorphan finds "orphaned"[2,5] packages on your system. It determines
which packages have no other packages depending on their installation,
and shows you a list of these packages.  It intends to be clone of
deborphan Debian tools for rpm packages.

It will try to help you to remove unused packages, for example:
* after a distribution upgrade
* when you want to suppress packages after some tests

Several tools are also provided :
* rpmusage - display rpm packages last use date
* rpmdep - display the full dependency of an installed rpm package
* rpmduplicates - find programs with several version installed
* rpmextra - find installed packages not in distribution

notes :
*******

For all users :
[1] this rpm package will make rpmorphan work in command line mode.
If you want to use a graphical interface, you will need to install extra 
rpm packages : perl-Tk or perl-Curses-UI.

For Fedora users : 
[2] Note that orphan is used in the sense of Debian's deborphan, and
is NOT the same as Fedora orphaned packages which are packages that
have no current maintainer.

[3] Yum offers a program called 'package-cleanup' which,
called with the '--leaves' option, can show quickly a list of
unused library packages.

[4] rpmorphan can be speed up by installing the perl-RPM2 rpm package

For Mandriva users :
[5] the 'urpme --auto-orphans' command show quickly a a list of
unused library packages.
